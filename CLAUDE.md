# Email Client

This folder contains Gmail MCP tools for managing Kevin's email.

## Address Book
Maintain `address_book.md` with contacts encountered. For each person, include:
- Email address
- Role/title
- Relationship to Kevin
- Communication style notes

Update this file when encountering new contacts or learning more about existing ones.

## Available tools
- `list_emails` - List recent emails from inbox
- `read_email` - Read full email content
- `send_email` - Send emails (supports reply threading)
- `search_emails` - Search with Gmail query syntax

## Guidelines
- Before drafting a reply, read recent emails with that person to understand the relationship and pick the appropriate tone automatically
- Check CC recipients from the email - they can dramatically shift tone (e.g., a VP on CC may require more formal/structured communication)
- Research CC recipients if unfamiliar to understand their role and adjust accordingly
- Always confirm with Kevin before sending
